# Pentesting-challenge
Switching field from Marketing to Pentesting!

Hi, I am from Hong Kong. 
I am a 3 years graduated filled with confusion.
After working in the marketing field i want to fufill my childhood dream to become a pentester.
It is a really really hard start!
I hope if there's anyone who can give me suggestions of how to switch field?
Would it be better for me to start to learn automation testing before going to pentesting?
Please!!!! leave a message to help this child.
Thank you!!!
